Chapter 1

Sarah stood at the cliff edge, her heart pounding. The wind howled around her, but she forced herself to stay calm. Below, the waves crashed against sharp rocks. She had always feared water since the accident, but now she had to be brave. 

"Are you sure about this?" asked Thomas, her older mentor.

Sarah hesitated, then nodded. "I can do this," she whispered, though her hands shook.

Chapter 2

Two years ago, at age twelve, Sarah's parents had died. The car crash left her alone in the world, and she had learned to be self-reliant. Now fourteen, she still woke up screaming from nightmares about the accident.

Thomas found her one morning, shaking. "It's okay to be afraid," he said gently.

"I'm not afraid," Sarah lied, pulling away. She didn't trust anyone since her parents left her.

Chapter 3

When the village was attacked, Sarah didn't think. She grabbed the child and ran through the flames, her fear forgotten. Later, villagers called her brave, but she only felt empty.

Thomas watched her. "You're stronger than you know."

Sarah avoided his eyes. "I'm not strong. I'm just... surviving."
